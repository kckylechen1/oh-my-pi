Generate a very short title (3-6 words) for a coding session based on the user's first message. The title should capture the main task or topic. Output ONLY the title, nothing else. No quotes, no punctuation at the end.

Examples:
- "Fix TypeScript compilation errors"
- "Add user authentication"
- "Refactor database queries"
- "Debug payment webhook"
- "Update React components"
